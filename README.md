# A Simulation Driven Deep Learning Approach for Separating Mergers and Star Forming Galaxies

Repository with all Tensorflow pre-trained models to separate Postmergers from Star Forming galaxies from Ferreira et al. 2022.

## Models

As described in the paper, each CANDELS field has two models associated with it. One for ACS imaging, covering redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.5 and a second one for 1.5 < z < 3.0 for WFC3.
